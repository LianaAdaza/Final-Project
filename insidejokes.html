      <p class = "kwktext"> Kode With Klossy is a coding camp that provides the opportunity for young women across the country from the ages 13-18 to attend for free and learn basic computer science concepts and skills. <br><br> This year's web development camp in Miami, Florida has taught many different concepts involving HTML, CSS and JavaScript. After learning the basics of tags, designs, and functions, scholars learned the language of a computer and were able to design their very own, full website.
      </br> <br> This website is the creation of three of the scholars: Zoe Zimsek, Liana Adaza, and Gaby Sebastian. </p>
